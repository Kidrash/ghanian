# Akan-Names

A web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. 

## Technologies Used

- HTML & CSS (Bootstrap)
- JavaScript (jQuery 3.4.1)
- Animate CSS

##### Requirements

Your birthdates and Gender


## Behaviour Driven Development

A disclaimer appears if you key in a wrong date i.e an invalid month/day/year. It will display the day you were born and also your akan name if you enter your birthday dates.
